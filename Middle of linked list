Floyd's Tortoise Hare Algorithm

1) Make two pointers - fast & slow pointing to head of linked list.
2) Increment fast by 2 and slow by 1.
3) Slow will reach the half way when fast reaches the end.

'''

def middleNode(head):
	slow,fast = head,head
	while (fast and fast.next):
		slow = slow.next
		fast = fast.next.next
	return slow
